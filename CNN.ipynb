    "## Convolutional Layers\n",
    "- Depth of output volume controls the number of neurons(i.e filters) in conv in the CONV layer that connect to a local region of the input\n",
    "- Depth of activation map will be K, or simply numner of filters we are learning in the current layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Activation layer\n",
    "- After each conv layer in CNN, we apply a nonlinear activation function,such as ReLU, ELU, etc.\n",
    "- Since the activation function is applied in an element-wise manner, the output of an activation layer is always the same as the input dimension\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pooling layers\n",
    "- To reduce size of input volume\n",
    "- Max pooling: 3x3 and stride=2\n",
    "- Overlapping pooling: F=3, s=2\n",
    "- Non overlapping: F=2, s=2\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fully Connected layers\n",
    "- Neurons in FC layer are fully connected to all activations in previous layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Batch Normalization\n",
    "- Used to normalize the activations of given input volume before passing it into next layer.\n",
    "- If we consider $x$ to be our mini-batch of activations, then we can compute the normalized $\\overline{x}$ via:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\overline{x} = \\frac{x_i-\\mu_{\\beta}}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_\\beta^2+\\epsilon}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "- During training we compute $\\mu_\\beta$ and $\\sigma_beta$ over eaech mini-batch $\\beta$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mu_\\beta = \\frac{1}{M}\\sum^m_{i=1}x_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{M}\\sum^m_{i=1}(x_i-\\mu_\\beta)^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "- We use $epsilon=1e-7$ to avoid dviding by zero.\n",
    "- Using this, the activations leaving a Batch Norm will have appx zero mean and unit variance.\n",
    "- At testing time, we replace the mini-batch $\\mu_\\beta$ and $\\sigma_\\beta$ with running averages of $\\mu_\\beta$ and $\\sigma_\\beta$ computed during the training process.\n",
    "- Shown to be effective in reducing number of epochs and stabilizing training.\n",
    "- Place BN after Activation layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dropout\n",
    "- form of regulariza-tion that aims to help prevent overfitting by increasing testing accuracy, perhaps at the expense of training accuracy.\n",
    "- For each mini-batch in our training set, dropout layers, with probability p, randomly disconnect inputs from the preceding layer to the next layer in the network architecture."
