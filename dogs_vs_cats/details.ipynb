    "- The reason we serialized the raw images into an HDF5 file rather than simply accessing mini-batches of image paths on disk when training is due to I/O latency – for each image on disk we would have to perform an I/O operation to read the image. \n",
    "- This subtle optimization doesn’t seem like a big deal, but I/O latency is a huge problem in a deep learning pipeline\n",
    "- If we serialize all images into an efficiently packed HDF5 file, we can leverage very fast array slices to extract our mini-batches, thereby dramatically reducing I/O latency and helping speed up the training process.\n",

    "- A patch preprocessor used to randomly extract M × N pixel regions from an image during training.\n",
    "    - We apply patch preprocessing when the spatial dimensions of our input images are larger than what the CNN expects – this is a common technique to help reduce overfitting, and is, therefore, a form of regularization.\n",
    "- We need to define a CropPreprocessor responsible for computing the 10-crops for over-sampling. During the evaluating phase of our CNN, we’ll crop the four corners of the input image + the center region and then take their corresponding horizontal flips, for a total of ten samples per input image. These ten samples will be passed through the CNN, and then the probabilities averaged"
