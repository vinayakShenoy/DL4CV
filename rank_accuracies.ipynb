        "- When reading deep learning literature, especially in the computer vision and image classification space, you’ll likely encounter the concept of ranked accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Rank-1 Accuracy\n",
        "- Rank-1 accuracy is the percentage of predictions where the top prediction matches the ground-truth label – this is the “standard” type of accuracy we are used to computing: take the total number of correct predictions and divide it by\n",
        "the number of data points in the dataset.\n",
        "- Below is the steps:\n",
        "  - Computing the class label probabilites for each input image in the dataset\n",
        "  - Determining if the ground-truth label is equal to predicted class label with the largest probability\n",
        "  - Tallying the number of times where Step 2 is true\n",

        "## Rank-5 accuracy\n",
        "- Steps to calculate Rank-5 accuracy\n",
        "  - Compute the class label probabilities for each input image in dataset\n",
        "  - Sort the predicted class label probabilities in descending order, such that labels with higher probabilities are places at the front of the list\n",
        "  - Determine if the ground-truth label exists in top-5 predicted labels from Step2\n",
        "  - Tally the number of times where Step3 is true"
